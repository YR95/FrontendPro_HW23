Given:

const amount = 100;
const monday = [
  ['Write a tutorial',180],
  ['Some web development',120]
];
const tuesday = [
  ['Keep writing that tutorial',240],
  ['Some more web development',360],
   ['A whole lot of nothing',240]
];
For Monday and Tuesday elements of the array should perform next methods:

-Convert time that had been taken for task implementation to the hours, from the minutes.
-Leave only these tasks that need more then 2 hours for implement.
-Multiply result on hourly rate (amount) and add this result as a third element of array.
-Render to the html table, with this example:
<tr>
  <td>Task name: Write a tutorial</td>
  <td>Taks duration: 3 hours</td>
  <td>Task amount: $300</td>
</tr>
Use only these methods concat/forEach/map/filter/join (as needed)
